RNA maps
--------

Distribution of cross-links relative to genomic landmarks.

What is an RNA-map?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Imagine the following situation (on positive strand)::

    |---intron1---||---exon2---||---intron2---||---exon3---|
                              x|-----R1-----|

Situation is simple: a read perfectly maps to reference genome. First cross-link
(nucletide before the start of read R1) is located -2 nucleotides before
landmark of type 'exon-intron'. By examining all cross-links(reads) that are
located in vicinity of landmarks one can obtain the distribution of
cross-link-to-landmark distances. Such distibution is called an RNA map.

Of course, situation gets complicated. Real-world-situation more likely looks
like this::

    |--------transcript1-------|
    |-ncRNA-||-intron-||-ncRNA-|
            |------------------transcript2-----------------|
            |--CDS--||-intron-||--CDS--||-intron-||--UTR3--|
                                    |---------------transcript3--------------|
                                    |-UTR5-||-intron-||-CDS-||-intron-||-CDS-|

             x|-----R1-----|
             x|R2.1->          <--R2.2-|
                                x|-R3-|


All sort of situations can arise:

    * read can intersect with multiple genes/transcripts/segments
      simultaneously, which means that one read is relevant for different types
      of RNA maps.
    * if whole read is mapped to one segment (as is read R3 on transcript2),
      then it is impossible to tell the type of RNA map it belongs to: is it
      CDS-intron or intron-CDS?
    * read can be mapped in multiple parts - for example when introns are
      removed before translation, first half of read will map to ``exon1`` and
      second half to ``exon2``.
    * same cross-link event can be represented by multiple reads with same
      random barcode.
    * ...


The algorithm takes care for all of this. Finally, it outputs a container
``data`` with the following structure::

    data = {
        rna_map_type: {relative_position: [all, explicit], ...}
        exon-intron: {-42: [1042, 114], -41: [784, 69] ...}
        exon-intron-neg: {-42: [219, 65], ...}
        ...
    }

The structure is a dict, with keys corresponding to different RNA map types.
Values are also dicts. Keys in these dicts are positions of cross links relative
to the landmark of the RNA map. Values for each position are lists: the first
and second element count number of *all* and *explicit* cross-link events
respectively. Cross link is explicit, if read identifying cross-link is mapped
to both parts of RNA-map. In upper example, R1 is explicit, since it maps to
intron *and* exon. Read R3 on transcript2 is implicit, since one has to decide
wheather it's cross-link belongs to ``CDS-intron`` or ``intron-CDS`` RNA map.
The term *all* means explicit + implicit in this context.

If read is implicit (start and stop within same segment), one can choose two
varinats of the algorithm. One can choose that whole score of read is given to
RNA-map of the closest landmark. Other option is to split score on half to both
neighbouring segments. This behaviour is controlled by parameter
implicit_handling.

There are also two cases when read can map in a way that is not predicted with annotation:

    * For split reads, second start can fall on nucleotide that is not start of
      a new segment. This behaviour is excactly the same as in xlsites analysis.
      Such reads are reported in file defined with ``strange`` parameter.
    * Reads that map on two different transcripts or even two different genes
      are repoted in file with name defined in cross_transcript.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things that still need to be resolved:

    * negative strand inspection:
        * for each ss_group, take annotation from reverse strand and check what
          is the situation on other side.
        * What si again the bio-contxt here - explain in docs...?
    * Test: Each cross-link should have the same cDNA count as in xlsites
      results. The final check should be: sum all scores - the result should be
      the same as for xlsites. Actually, the metrics.cross_transcript should
      also be considered:
      assert: sum(xlsites scores) == sum(RNAmaps "all" + metrics.cross_transc)
    * if read crosses two ore more regions from start to end, only end-type is
      considered for RNAmap type. Should we fix this and which region type to
      take? Since reads are tpyically much shorted than regions, this is
      probably a rare case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wishes and ideas(Jernej, Tomaz):

    * The whole idea is to get a feeling what is happening around landmarks

    * separate pre-mRNA and mRNA [this is partially done in _add_entry]
        * Life cyle of RNA: part of DNA in transcribed to RNA in nucleus. Introns
          are cut out already between this process! Really???
        * pre-mRNA contains introns, mature mRNA has no introns and goes outside
          from the nucleus.
        * so: RNAmap exon-intron will for sure contain only pre-mRNA, but RNAmap
          exon-exon can contain pre-mRNA and mRNA... It would be really nice to
          report on percentage of theese two categories.
        * This can be done by introducing three categories:  pre-mRNa, mRNA and
          undecided. This can be determined from results - they contain explicit /
          implicit info and RNAmap type:

    * Intoduce three categories (colors in visualisation?) in every RNAmap type.
      Let's take exon-intron as example:

        * whole read in left part - color #1 (negative coord, implicit)
        * whole read in right part - color #2 (positive coord, implicit)
        * read crossing junction - color #3 (explicit)

    * How to handle situation when one region in individual's sequence clearly
      differs from reference sequence but it is just some variation?

        * Change the reference sequence? This can be complex... Make a helper
          tool for this?
        * Provide additional data in function - which exceptions /abnormalities
          to ignore?

    * Gaussian smooting of RNAmaps?

    * split read - it can differ also on "first-stop", not juts second-start
        * we could have some sort of quality check when observing the variance
          of first-stop-s. THe major question is: "Do all reads for certain
          xlink event indicate the same behaviour?"

    * Normalization?
